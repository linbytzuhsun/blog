		According to the research, the Google searching engine has the highest number of percentage in searching engine marker share, the worldwide market share of all search engines has been rather lopsided. Clement states, “Google has dominated the search engine market, maintaining an 88.47 percent market share as of April 2019”(Clement, 2019). Nowadays, most of the people receive all the information from the internet instead of a library or television, so it would be a huge advantage if the marketer understands how the Google searching engine works by providing the information that marketers want it to show. How does Google knows what we are looking for all the time, and bring up all the information we need. On the other hand, it is significant for all internet users and digital marketers to understand how google algorithms work in order to be efficient and successful.

		SEO is the acronym of “Search Engine Optimization”, which is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines. Google has primary search results, where web pages and other content such as videos or local listings are shown and ranked based on what the search engine considers most relevant to users. Payment is not involved, as it is with paid search ads.

		When the internet users are trying to search for some keywords on Google, the top three results are advertisements, which means people have to pay for that position and the other results are nature searching results which are the websites that contain the most matched information to your keywords. So how does Google decide the order of the results? There is a system called the “Google algorithms” that manage all the information inside the websites in order to provide the best results to internet users. SEO is a process that follows the rules of Google algorithms to optimize the website content or layout for improving the ranking in the natural result.
